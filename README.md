# Techfall

**Techfall** is a narrative-driven Unity game about technology, control, and choice.

The player takes the role of an intern in a tech company on their first day at work.  
Their first task seems simple: **build and maintain a tower** that represents the company’s technology stack.

Under constant pressure from a **toxic and demanding employer**, the player is pushed to work faster, optimize more, and never stop. Mistakes are punished, hesitation is criticized, and success is never enough.

Through a symbolic **Jenga-style gameplay**, the player physically interacts with different layers of modern technology, trying to keep the system stable while external pressure keeps increasing.
The experience is designed to be immersive, with the player using their hands and body to interact directly with the structure.

## What is the Game About?

In Techfall, technology is represented as a physical structure made of blocks.  
Each block stands for a part of the tech world (data, hardware, training, security, applications).

Every action affects the balance of the system.

The game asks a simple question:  
**What happens when a system grows too complex to control?**

## Core Gameplay

- The main gameplay is inspired by **Jenga**
- The player removes and places blocks
- Every move makes the structure more unstable
- Mistakes, hesitation, or overconfidence can cause collapse

The gameplay is simple, but the consequences are not.

## Outcomes & Endings

The game has **three main outcomes**, based on the player’s actions:

### 1. Resignation - The Farm
If the player chooses to quit, they leave the tech world behind.  
The game transitions to a **quiet farm**, symbolizing a return to a slower, human-scale life.

### 2. Failure - A World Without Technology
If the player loses and the system collapses, the game moves to a **post-technology world**.  
Technology is gone. What remains is emptiness, silence, and a reset.

### 3. Success - AI Takeover
If the player performs perfectly and maintains full control, **AI takes over**.  
Human input is no longer needed.  
Efficiency wins - but at a cost.

Each ending reflects a different relationship between humans and technology.

## Who Is This Game For?

Techfall is made for:
- Players interested in **story-driven games**
- People curious about **technology and AI**
- Players who enjoy **symbolic and experimental gameplay**
- Students and creators exploring interactive storytelling

No technical background is required to understand the game.

## Design Philosophy

Techfall avoids direct realism in favor of **symbolic representation**.  
Technology is not shown as code or machines, but as fragile structures that rely on balance, responsibility, and restraint.

The game invites the player to question:

> *Is technological progress about building higher - or knowing when to stop?*

## Status

This project is currently under development as a Unity-based experimental narrative game.

### 1. Install Git LFS (once)
```bash
git lfs install
````

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letisjamuco/techfall.git
```

### 3. If assets are missing

```bash
git lfs pull
```
